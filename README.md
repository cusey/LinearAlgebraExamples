# Linear Algebra Examples  

## Introduction     
* Vector is a list of numbers
* Matrix is like a spreadsheet of numbers

Linear algebra is used to solve problems in engineering, calculus, differential equations, finance, economics,
biology, ect...

The compactness and elegance of linear algebra is intrinsically satisfying.

The smooth links between algebra and geometric ard beautiful.  

Linear algebra is the backbone of most  modern computational algorithms, and therefore learning linear algebra will improve your programming skills. 
  
## Terminology  
### When People say:
* Linear algebra they are focusing on the theory and proofs
* Matric algebra they are focusing on on applications

### Graph Theory  
In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs, or lines. A graph may be undirected, meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another.
